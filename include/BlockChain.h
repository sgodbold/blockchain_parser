#ifndef BLOCK_CHAIN_H

#define BLOCK_CHAIN_H


// This is a minimal C++ code snippet to read the bitcoin block chain one by one into memory.
//
// This code uses almost no dynamic memory allocation, no STL, no Boost, no containers (other than a very simple fixed size hash table for lookups),
// and it is only a few thousand lines of C++.
// It uses hard-coded arrays with fixed limits in their sizes.  This is because the actual data in the bitcoin blockchain
// does not ever exceed certain limits; so to avoid a great deal of unnecessary memory allocation this parser uses fixed buffers
// instead.
//
// Note, this code needs to be compiled on a 64bit machine as it now is able to load every single bitcoin transaction which has ever occurred
// into memory for analysis and reporting.  Obviously this uses quite a bit of memory.
//
// It's also pretty fast though, I suppose, it could be made faster, but not by a lot.  Some people might point out that it could be made faster
// if it cached the source block-chain file but, really, virtually all operating systems do that under the hood any way so 
// I doubt it would make much difference.  As it is, it reads one bitcoin blockchain 'block' into memory at a time, parses the transactions,
// inputs, and outputs, and returns them to the caller.  A person who would use this code snippet would, most likely, take this data
// and convert it into some other more reasonable format for further processing and analysis.  At least that's what I plan to do.
//
// On my machine the bitcoin blockchain data is comprised of 68 files each about 128mb apiece totaling 9.2gb.
//
// My machine parses this entire data set in roughly 95 seconds.
//
// It is important to note that this code assumes that you are running on a small-endian machine, like an X86.  It *does not* run on 
// big-endian machines (like a PowerPC for example).  If you have a big-endian machine, what can I say, get a real processor.

//
// This code snippet was written by John W. Ratcliff (jratcliffscarab@gmail.com) on June 30, 2013 on a lazy rainy Sunday afternoon 
//
// Note, this source was updated on January 1, 2014.  I worked on it over Christmas break.  It can now process every single transaction
// into memory, organize all public key addresses, and do some analysis on the blockchain.
//
// I wrote this code snippet for two reasons.  First, I just wanted to understand the bitcoin blockchain format myself and
// since I run the full bitcoin-qt client on my machine, I have all the data stored on my hard drive anyway.
//
// The second reason I wrote it is that I have an interest in doing some analysis on the block-chain data and, to do that, I first need to
// be able to parse the transactions.  When I looked at available resources on the internet they all use various scripting languages and 
// JSON-RPC.  That just screams stunningly, outrageously, absurdly, slow to me.
//
// The specific data I want to analyze it a study of the historical data value of outstanding and current bitcoins in circulation.
//
// There was an excellent paper published on this, but it was produced by processing an insane colliction of HTML files to get the output which
// makes their data almost instantly obsolete.
//
// Right now there is a big mystery about how many of the dormant bitcoins are irrevocably lost or are merely waiting to be cashed in at some
// point in the future.  There is really no way to know for sure, however, we can look at how many presumed dormant coins come out of hiding
// over time.  It's an interesting data mining exercise at any rate, and I wanted to be able to play around with exploring the dataset.
//
// Before I wrote this code snippet, like a good programmer, I first looked around the internet to see if I could just download something that would
// do the same thing.
//
// However, yet once again, I ran into the same nonsense that I always run into.  The most commonly referenced C++ code sample that shows how to read the blockchain
// has enormous dependencies and does not build out of the box.  I find this sort of thing terribly annoying.
//
// This code snippet is just a single header file and a single CPP.  In theory it should compile on any platform, all you have to do is revise a couple
// of typedefs at the top of the header to declare the basic int sizes on your platform.  It is well documented and, I believe, very easy to read and understand.
//
// That's it.  It doesn't use the STL, Boost, or another heavyweight dependences above and beyond standard library type stuff.
//
// I did find this excellent reference online; from which this code was written.  Think of this code snippet as essentially just a reference implementation
// of what is already covered on Jame's blog.
//
// If you find this code snippet useful; you can tip me at this bitcoin address:

//
// https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_specification
//
// One problem with Jame's specifiction is it's not always super clear what the heirachy of the input data is; the classes in this header file
// should hopefully make that a bit more clear.
//
// An important note, a number of the inputs in the blockchain are marked as 'variable length integers' (presumablye to 'save space' even though they really don't)
// The variable length integer is capable of being as large as 64 bits but, in actuality, never is.
// That's why all of the integers in the following data structures are 32 bits in size.
//
// A couple of items; sometimes you can run out of blockchain data before you reach the end of the file.  Past a certain point the file just contains zeroes.
// This was not documented in Jame's page; but it is what I encounterd in the input data set.
//
// There are also many cases where the actual data in the block is a lot less than the reported block-length.  I'm going to assume that this too is normal
// and expected.
